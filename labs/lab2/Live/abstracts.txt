The Kidney Precision Medicine Project and Single-Cell Biology of the Injured Proximal Tubule
Danielle Janosevic, Thomas De Luca , Kidney Precision Medicine Project, Michael T. Eadon
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has led to major advances in our understanding of proximal tubule subtypes in health and disease. The proximal tubule serves essential functions in overall homeostasis, but pathologic or physiologic perturbations can affect its transcriptomic signature and corresponding tasks. These alterations in proximal tubular cells are often described within a scRNA-seq atlas as cell states, which are pathophysiologic subclassifications based on molecular and morphological changes in a cell’s response to that injury compared to its native state. This review describes the major cell states defined in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project’s (KPMP) scRNA-seq atlas. The review then identifies the overlap between KPMP and other seminal works which may use different nomenclature or cluster proximal tubule cells at different resolutions to define cell state subtypes. The goal is for the reader to understand the key transcriptomic markers of important cellular injury and regeneration processes across this highly dynamic and evolving field.

Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) have wide application prospects in microelectronic fields such as wearable electronics due to merits of stable performance, high safety and easy integration. However, the relatively low energy density of MSCs limits their practical application. In this context, phosphorus and fluorine co-doped laser-induced graphene (FP-LIG) microelectrodes were fabricated from fluorinated polyimide containing phosphoric acid by laser direct writing (LDW) method. The introduced phosphoric acid slows down the decomposition of -CF3 during the LDW process, resulting in much more ordered and stable pores; meanwhile, phosphorus entered the graphene lattice to replace some carbon atoms, forming a C3PO structure, which not only stabilizes the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte and therefore achieves an enlarged working potential of 1.4 V, but also increases the wettability of the electrode. Using FP-3-LIG microelectrodes and PVA/H2SO4 as the gel electrolyte, the assembled FP-3-MSC demonstrates significantly enhanced energy density, delivering an energy density of 10.40 μWh cm-2 (@0.09 mA cm-2), 2.7 times that of F-MSC and 346.7 times that of MSC. FP-3-MSC has excellent cyclic stability, displaying an areal capacitance retention rate of above 90 % after 10,000 long cycles. In addition, FP-3-MSC demonstrates excellent flexibility, indicating promising potential in the field of flexible wearable electronics.

Evaluation of Probability Distribution Methods for Flood Frequency Analysis in the Jhelum Basin of North-Western Himalayas, India
Asif Iqbal Shah, Nibedita Das 
The Kashmir Valley has frequently endured devastating floods, presenting significant challenges for flood management due to unpredictable flood magnitudes and limited pre-disaster preparedness. A major difficulty in addressing these challenges is the lack of reliable flood frequency analysis (FFA) for effective planning and mitigation. This study seeks to overcome these issues by employing a rigorous quantitative analysis of annual peak discharge data over a 51-year period (1971-2021). One key challenge was the presence of low outliers, which could compromise the integrity of the data. To address this, the Multiple Grubbs-Beck test was applied to remove these outliers before conducting FFA. The study's original achievement lies in its application of multiple distribution models which include Gumbel (EV1), Generalized Extreme Variations (GEV), Log-Normal, Log Pearson III (LP III), Gamma and Normal distribution. Goodness-of-fit tests, including Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS), Anderson-Darling (AD), and Chi-square at the 5% significance level, along with visualization techniques such as Probability plots (PP), Quantile plots (QQ), and Probabilistic distribution (PD) graphs, were used to identify the most suitable distribution methods. The Log Pearson Type III (LP-III) was identified as the best fit for the Sangam gauge site (Upper Jhelum), the gamma distribution for Ram Munshibagh (Middle Jhelum), and the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) and LP-III for Asham (Lower Jhelum). For Sangam, the estimated discharges for 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250-year return periods were 549.63, 1028.43, 1471.34, 2907.64, 3758.92, 4338.61, 4790.99, and 5167.23 cumecs, respectively, using LP-III. For Ram Munshibagh, the discharges were 602.13, 911.03, 1107.04, 1512.12, 1674.35, 1767.0, 1831.87, and 1881.74 cumecs using the gamma distribution. For Asham, the discharges were 685.8, 998.0, 1193.3, 1593.2, 1750.6, 1839.4, 1901.0, and 1948.0 cumecs using the GEV distribution. The findings indicate that the Jhelum River cannot accommodate excess discharge for return periods of 5 years or more, underscoring the need for enhanced flood management strategies.

Effects of Bedroom Environment on Average Heart Rate During Sleep in Temperate Regions: A Nonlinear Analysis of Annual Variations in Healthy Males in Their Twenties with Average BMI
Noriaki OOTA, Yasuki YAMAUCHI, Gota IWASE, Masaru ABUKU, Yasuhiro HIRAGURI
Models obtained in our previous studies were adapted from a linear model. In these models, the operative temperature has a positive coefficient with respect to the average heart rate during sleep (SHR) in summer and a negative coefficient in winter. Therefore, there are limitations to using linear models to examine annual variations. This study attempted nonlinear modeling and conducted an analysis. The participants were nine healthy males in their twenties, with an average body mass index, living in a temperate region. The objective variable was SHR. The explanatory variables were the body movement rate during sleep (BM), room temperature, radiant temperature, bed microclimate temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration. In addition, the interaction effects between the bed microclimate temperature and CO2 concentration were considered because they showed significant correlations in the linear model. Results showed that the BM and SHR exhibited a positive linear correlation throughout the year. Radiant temperature showed a higher importance than room temperature in winter, as evaluated by permutation importance. SHR was lowest when room and radiant temperatures were approximately 25 [℃] to 26 [℃]; under higher or lower temperatures, the SHR increased. Additionally, when temperatures fell below 10 [℃], the trend shifted to a positive correlation. Bed microclimate temperature and SHR showed a positive correlation when exceeding 30 [℃]. The CO2 concentration and SHR exhibited a positive correlation below 1000 [ppm] during autumn and winter. Overall, a greater understanding of how environmental conditions affect SHR could enable the design of environments that promote a lower heart rate during sleep.

Owing to its excellent machinability and less toxicity, bismuth brass has been widely used in manufacturing various industrial products. Thus, it is of significance to perform rapid and accurate identification of bismuth brass to reveal the alloying properties. However, the analytical lines of various elements in bismuth brass alloy products based on conventional laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) are usually weak. Moreover, the analytical lines of various elements are often overlaped, seriously interfering with the identification of bismuth brass alloys. To address these challenges, developing an advanced strategy enabling to achieve ultra-high accuracy identification of bismuth brass alloys is highly desirable.

Personalized food consumption detection with deep learning and Inertial Measurement Unit sensor
Lehel Dénes-Fazakas, Barbara Simon, Adám Hartvég, László Szilágyi, Levente Kovács, Amir Mosavi, György Eigner
For individuals diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, it is crucial to keep a record of the carbohydrates consumed during meals, as this should be done at least three times daily, amounting to an average of six meals. Unfortunately, many individuals tend to overlook this essential task. For those who use an artificial pancreas, carbohydrate intake proves to be a critical factor, as it can activate the insulin pump in the artificial pancreas to deliver insulin to the body. To address this need, we have developed personalized deep learning model that can accurately detect carbohydrate intake with a high degree of accuracy. Our study employed a publicly available dataset gathered by an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which included accelerometer and gyroscope data. The data was sampled at a rate of 15 Hz, necessitating preprocessing. For our tailored to the patient model, we utilized a recurrent network comprising Long short-term memory (LSTM) layers. Our findings revealed a median F1 score of 0.99, indicating a high level of accuracy. Additionally, the confusion matrix displayed a difference of only 6 s, further validating the model’s accuracy. Therefore, we can confidently assert that our model architecture exhibits a high degree of accuracy. Our model performed well above 90% on the dataset, with most results between 98%–99%. The recurrent networks improved the problem-solving capabilities significantly, though some outliers remained. The model’s average prediction latency was 5.5 s, suggesting that later meal predictions result in extended meal progress predictions. The dataset’s limitation of mostly single-day data points raises questions about multi-day performance, which could be explored by collecting multi-day data, including night periods. Future enhancements might involve transformer networks and shorter time windows to improve model responsiveness and accuracy. Therefore, we can confidently assert that our model exhibits a high degree of accuracy.

Industrialization has significantly compromised air quality, environmental health, and human well-being. Therefore, it is highly necessary to develop efficient and cost-effective strategies to resolve the issue of environmental pollution while promoting sustainable energy production. Catalysts play a crucial role in the synthesis and conversion of valuable chemicals by providing more active sites that accelerate catalytic reactions, leading to proper activity and selectivity. However, challenges such as catalyst stability, cost-effectiveness, high surface area, reusability, and low loading amount need to be addressed. In this regard, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) could be an intelligent choice due to their tunable structure through altering metal centers and organic ligands along with their structural flexibility, high specific surface area, and diversity. These porous materials have found extensive application in heterogeneous catalysis and environmental remediation thanks to their low cost, abundance in nature and feasible preparation routes. Among first-row transition metal-based MOFs like vanadium (V)- and manganese (Mn)-containing structures have gained popularity in environmental remediation and catalysis due to their different redox states, stability, cost-effectiveness. As limited number of review articles have addressed V and Mn-containing MOFs compared to other first-row transition metals like Ni, Co, Cu and Fe, this review aims at exploring recent advancements in the V- and Mn-based MOFs, their composites, and derivatives within heterogeneous catalysis, highlighting applications in oxidative fuel desulfurization, CO2 reduction, epoxidation, hydroxylation, oxidation of organic compounds, and environmental remediation, including the adsorption and elimination of organic dyes and CO2 capture and conversion. Also, the review emphasizes the structure-performance relationship, offering new insights for overcoming existing challenges and advancing the field.

Shuai Liu, Hui Qin,Zhengyang Tang, Keyan Shen, Xu Yang, Zhiwei Zheng, Yuhua Qun, Zhiwei Jia
Accurately capturing reservoir dispatching rules is crucial for mitigating carbon emissions and preventing flooding and inundation. However, the short operational duration of certain reservoirs poses challenges in acquiring sufficient data samples for reservoir rule simulation. Furthermore, the nonlinear and fluctuating characteristics of reservoir dispatching rules present obstacles to their precise prediction. To address these challenges, this study proposes a hybrid embedding-based Informer (Heformer) dispatching rules extraction framework. Initially, extensive data series are employed for modeling to acquire a comprehensive sample dataset. Subsequently, the Heformer model, based on the Informer architecture and integrating the Dimension-Segment-Wise (DSW) strategy and feature representation strategy, is introduced for capturing reservoir dispatching rules. To assess performance of the proposed model, it is compared against several recognized state-of-the-art models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively captures the operational characteristics of reservoirs, mitigates bias impact in reservoir prediction and operation, and provides a reference for extracting dispatching rules for reservoirs

A marine oil spill detection framework considering special disturbances using Sentinel-1 data in the Suez Canal
Lingxiao Cheng, Ying Li,Mian Qin, Bingxin Liu
The Suez Canal is a crucial international waterway due to its strategic location. The significant traffic flow not only stimulates economic development along the coast but also leads to a high frequency of oil spill accidents, which negatively impact the ecosystem and natural resources. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important remote sensing technology for monitoring oil spills, offering all-day and all-weather capabilities. However, special disturbances (SD) caused by imaging conditions, sensor parameters, and other factors can affect image quality, reducing the accuracy and efficiency of oil spill detection. To mitigate the negative impact of SD, an original oil spill detection framework was developed, based on the analysis of these disturbances, to detect oil spills at the northern entrance of the Suez Canal from 2015 to 2019. The framework included an advantageous featureset with SD adaptability and designs a classifier, Boosting Random Support Vector Machine (BRSVM), which combines a boosting strategy with Support Vector Machine (SVM). The study found that the superiority of the featureset was pivotal in oil spill detection. The classification accuracy and F-1 score achieved by BRSVM were 94.72 % and 95.33 %, respectively, outperforming other algorithms in functionality. These results indicate that the proposed framework holds significant potential for applications requiring large-scale, automated oil spill detection.

Ziting Pan, Ziqiang Li, Yuting Li, Guan Huang,Fan Zou, Likang Pan , Mingyan Lin, Feng Li, Chao Geng, Xinyang Li
Satellite-to-ground communication, quantum communication, and intra-city communication all benefit from free-space optical communication. Coupling as much light power as possible into optical fibers is crucial for free-space optical communication, where atmospheric turbulence and platform sway will affect the coupling effect. This paper introduces a scheme for free-space optical communication utilizing a single adaptive fiber coupler, which can mitigate turbulence and other disturbances at minimal cost. Experimental results in a 2 km urban atmosphere show that our method can increase coupling power by up to 20% for the majority of the time. Moreover, the bit error rate of communication reduces from 4.53×10-4 to 3.80×10-8 after implementing the closed-loop correction and we also demonstrate video transmission. Additionally, this scheme can be combined with coherent beam combining and spatial diversity techniques, offering a comprehensive solution to both tip/tilt aberration and scintillation issues.

Effects of long-term exposure to high-altitude on episodic memory: The moderating role of daytime dysfunction
Getong Tao, Hailin Ma, Yanjie Su
Chronic exposure to high-altitude hypoxic environments may influence short-term memory and working memory. However, its impact on long-term memory, specifically episodic memory, remains understudied. In this study, we systematically investigated the effects of long-term exposure to high altitude (3650 m) on episodic memory, including item memory and source memory. Moreover, we examined the moderating role of daytime dysfunction on the relationship between altitude and episodic memory. In total, 97 participants were enrolled in the study: 49 were from the high altitude (HA) group, comprising those born and raised in low altitude (LA) areas (< 500 m) and had migrated to HA for 2∼3 years after turning 18; and 48 were from the LA group, who had never lived at high altitude. Episodic memory was evaluated using a what-when-where task, whereas daytime dysfunction was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. For item memory, hit rate and correct rejection rate were significantly lower in the HA group relative to the LA group. For source binding memory, the performance in what-where binding and what-when-where binding were decreased in the HA group, but the what-when binding did not differ between the two groups. Furthermore, the effects of altitude on hit rate, what-where binding, and what-when-where binding were significantly pronounced in individuals with higher levels of daytime dysfunction. These findings suggest that long-term exposure to high-altitude hypoxic environments influences episodic memory performance, including item recognition and source-binding memory. Specifically, spatial source memory is affected by high-altitude exposure, whereas temporal source memory remains unaffected. Moreover, these results highlight the importance of considering sleep quality, especially good daytime function, in maintaining optimal episodic memory function following chronic exposure to high altitudes.

In order to facilitate the shift towards sustainable practices and to support the transition to renewable energy, there is a requirement for faster and more accurate predictions of solar irradiance. Surface solar energy predictions are essential for the establishment of solar farms and the enhancement of energy grid management. This paper presents a novel approach to forecast surface solar irradiance up to 24 h in advance, utilizing various machine and deep learning architectures. Our proposed Machine Learning (ML) models include both point-based (1D) and grid-based (3D) solutions, offering a comprehensive exploration of different methodologies. Our forecasts leverage two days of input data to predict the next day of solar exposure at country scale. To assess the models’ performance, extensive testing is conducted across three distinct geographical areas of interest: Austria (where models were trained and validated), Switzerland and Italy (where we tested our models under a transfer learning regime), and sensitivity to the season is also discussed. The study incorporates comparisons with established benchmarks, including state-of-the-art numerical weather predictions, as well as fundamental predictors such as climatology and persistence. Our findings reveal that the ML-based methods clearly outperform traditional forecasting techniques, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability in predicting surface solar irradiance. This research not only contributes to the advancement of solar energy forecasting but also highlights the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models in being competitive to conventional methods for short-term solar irradiance predictions.

Strategic roadmapping to accelerate and risk-mitigate enabling innovations: A generalizable method and a case illustration for marine renewable energy
J.V. Sinfield, A. Ajmani, W. McShane
Understanding technological evolution and its implications is increasingly important as the public and private sectors harness next generation technologies to address society's major challenges. Current roadmapping methods for these enabling innovations suffer from several limitations and often shed more light on technology viability than adoptability, leading many to frame related pursuits as unpredictable high-risk, high-reward activities. However, recent research highlights that the risk associated with developing enabling innovations depends more on the approach to pursuit than the technology itself. Drawing on this perspective, we put forward a strategic roadmapping approach that overcomes historical limitations by: 1.) framing technological advance as a complex socio-technical transition and 2.) drawing upon related patterns of high-impact innovation to inform unique roadmapping analyses. The result – the Enabling Innovation Strategic Roadmapping method – examines technical, economic, and socio-cultural barriers to progress to define windows of opportunity in which viable technological capabilities can be matched to adoption-ready needs within and beyond the motivating sector, fostering advance toward a long-term vision, technology convergence, valley of death avoidance, and means to influence ecosystem evolution. To illustrate the methodology, we develop a strategic roadmap for marine hydrokinetic energy technologies that could support the advent of a marine renewable energy economy.
